# Egg Dungeon

A simple random dungeon generator example using PhaserJS.

# Goals:

- Create a randomly generated dungeon layout with sensible rooms including
  - ~A start and finish~
  - ~No inaccessible areas~
  - ~Items~
  - ~Monsters~
- ~Create Documentation~
- ~Add in-game controls~
- ~Fireballs (Death Orb)~

# Future Features

Things to come in future iterations:

- Level number tracking
- High Score Tracking
- ~MORE ORBS~ **DONE**
- ES6 Refactor (Refactor scene into a Class so that other scenes can be added easily and modularized)

# Setup -- Development:

To get started, clone or down this repository. Then, from the root of the project, run `npm run dev` to start the application. The app should start at `localhost:8080`.

The project uses an npm package called `live-server` to host the app and utilizies live reloading on all JS, HTML, and CSS files. You can see the exact script in the package.json file
